# Crab Island Concessions
 
## Abstract:
Crab Island is a sand bar used for recreation by tourist. Crab Island’s occupancy
consist of locally owned boats, rental boats and chartered excursions. Concession
vendors navigate small watercraft to conduct sales among the sandbar. The vendors
communicate with the captains via VHF radio on channel 63 to handle request made
by tourist among the chartered excursions.
## Problem Statement:
Upon conducting an analysis of productivity and adversing effectiveness, a few
problems exist that can be broken down into 2 categories. The results are based upon
visual monitoring of the vendors and VHF radio monitoring.
The first issue is that tourist are unaware of what products are available. Their
saturation is based upon what they can see around them at the time of arrival and what
vendors physically pass by them during the duration of their visit. This model defines
how the vendors advertise.
The second issue is the lack of geolocation tools as in there are no reference
structures to aid in geolocation. Captains make request via VHF radio for a specific
vendor and the vendor responds. Location information is exchanged between both
parties but it cannot be assumed accurate therefor a massive delay in delivery time is
observed. It can almost be comparable to describing to someone a single star in a sky
full of stars. This defines how effective vendors are at delivering.
## Solution Statement:
The proposed solution consist of next gen software development tailored to this
specific application. The application will work as the following. Stickers with QR codes
are to be placed in all rental and chartered vessels. Customers scan the QR with their
mobile devices and then are redirected to Crab Island Concessions website. There they
can brows all products offered by the vendors and see vendor availability per daily
basis. Product containers inside the website are managed by each vendor via
credentialed accounts. This greatly improves the advertising potential issue discussed
earlier.
The second benefit offered with this software are geolocation tools. Mobile
devices have GPS and cellular triangulation capabilities that can be utilized for
assisting vendors. Customer location data will be shared to the vendor’s account. The
vendors account would display a map and a compass to assist in navigating to the
customer of which submitted the request. This would reduce delay time, aid in
navigation, create a first-order-first-served option and also assist medical personnel
locate a distress signal option if provided with software.
